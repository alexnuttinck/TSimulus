Conditional time series
-----------------------

The values produced by a time series can be influenced by the values of a binary time series.
The conditional time series takes a binary time series, called the condition, as a parameter, as well as
one or two arbitrary times series.

The value produced by the conditional time series is determined by the following rules:

* If the condition value is not defined, the value of the conditional time series is also not defined.

* If the condition value is true, the value of the conditional time series is the value of the first arbitrary time series.

* If the condition value is false, the value of the conditional time series is the value of the second arbitrary time series.

**Representation in the configuration document:**

name
    The name given to the generator describing a time series.
    This name must be unique among all generators in the configuration document.

type
    Mandatory. Must be "conditional".

condition
    Mandatory. The generator describing the condition time series.

success
    Mandatory. The generator describing a time series, the values of which are used if the condition is verified.

failure
    Optional. The generator describing a time series, the values of which values are used if the condition
    is not verified. If not specified, a :ref:`undefined` generator is used instead.


**Example**::

    {
      "name": "conditional-generator",
      "type": "conditional",
      "condition": { "type" : "true" },
      "success": { "type": "constant", "value": 17 },
      "failure": { "type": "constant", "value": 42 }
    }

Because the values of the tested time series are always true, all the values generated by this conditional time series
will be 17.
