About Generators
================

The main goal of generators is to describe the constraints that shape the generated time series.

Several kinds of generators are detailed in this section. Primary generators describe time-based or even simpler
constraints and don't rely on any other generator. You can consider them as the building blocks of your time series.

Generators may be combined in various ways in order to produce more complex generators. Such composite generators express
time series whose values are the result of the aggregation, the comparision, the correlation, etc. of the values generated by time series
described by other generators.

While most generators describe time series producing numerical values, others can describe binary time series, i.e. time
series that only generated true or false values. Such values are typically used in a condition, and can result from
a test on one or many time series value(s). Composite binary generators support the basic and secondary boolean operations.
