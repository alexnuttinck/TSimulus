How to Use the Library
**********************

Time Series Generation
======================

Time series can be generated according to the rules described in a configuration document. You may consider to use
our `CLI application <https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-cli>`_ that reads configuration documents from a regular JSON file.

Alternatively, you could consider to use `our microservice <https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-ms>`_ that listen for HTTP requests. In that case, the configuration document
is submitted as a parameter of a POST request.

A First Example
===============

Examples of complete configuration documents, as well as the way to convert them in order to generate time series values,
are available in the :ref:`get_started` section of this documentation.
