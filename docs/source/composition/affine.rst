Affine Function
---------------

This is a transformation time series based on the application of a function on the underlying time series.
More specifically, at any time, the value of the new time series is the application of a function on the value of
the underlying time series for the considered time.

While the generator is design to apply any arbitrary function to time series values, using the configuration document
one can specify only affine functions.

This time series can be described as an :ref:`aggregation <aggregation>` of several time series
(including :ref:`constant <constant>` time series), and should therefore be considered as a shortcut for
a definition of this specific composition.

**Representation in the configuration document:**

name
    The name associated to the generator describing a time series.
    This name must be unique among all generators in the configuration document.

type
    Mandatory. Must be ‘function’.

generator
    Mandatory. Describes, by reference or inline definition, the generator of the time series on which
    the new time series is based.

slope
    Mandatory. The first derivative of the linear function belonging to the affine function.
    This coefficient is applied to any value provided by the underlying time series.

intercept
    Mandatory. Specifies the y-intercept of the affine function applied to the values generated by
    the underlying time series. The relation between the new time series and the underlying one is therefore:
    *y=slope*x + intercept* , where *y* represents the values generated by the new time series,
    and *x* represents the values of the underlying time series.


**Example**::

   {
      "name": "function-generator",
      "type": "function",
      "generator": { "type" : "constant", "value" : 42 },
      "slope": 1.4,
      "intercept" : 9.2
    }
