Partial Time Series
-------------------

Instead of specifying the periods during which a time series must not generate any values, one can specify the periods
during which the time series must generate these values.

This transformation time series is the complement of the :ref:`limited time series <limited>`.

**Representation in the configuration document:**

name
    The name given to the generator describing a time series. This name must be unique among all generators
    in the configuration document.

type
    Mandatory. Must be "partial".

generator
    Mandatory. The generator describing the underlying time series.

from
    Optional. If specified, indicates the date from which the values generates by the underlying time series
    must by generated. By default, there is no lower limit, and values must be generated until the higher limit.

to
    Optional. If specified, indicates the date to which the values generated by the underlying time series
    must be generated. By default, there is no higher limit, and values must be generated from the lower limit.

missing-rate
    Optional. Must be a number between 0 and 1. If specified, indicates the probability that a generated value
    will be considered as missing, despite the fact that the lower and higher time constraints are verified.
    A value of 0 means that no value will be missed ; a value of 1 means that all the values will be missed.
    By default, this parameter is set to 0.


**Example**::

    {
      "name": "partial-generator",
      "type": "partial",
      "generator": "daily-generator",
      "from": "2016-01-01 00:00:00.000",
      "to": "2016-04-23 00:00:00.000",
      "missing-rate": 0.001
    }
