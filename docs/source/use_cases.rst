A sensor for Colectme
=====================

Colectme is a set of tools developed in the `EAM-SDI project <https://www.cetic.be/EAM-SDI-2301>`_ for collecting, storing,
and processing log data from data centers.

The TSimulus library has been used in this project as a data source exploited by `a gateway <https://gitlab.com/colectme/gateway>`_
in order to simulate log events representing the history of resources consumption.
